# shopify-to-printify-api

This is an Express/Node.js API that allows users to create custom print-on-demand orders with printify.
This allows extensive Printify intergeration without exposing sensitive customer information on the front-end.

API options include:
- Checking item availibity
- Creating custom print order
- Checking Printify order status
- Fullfilling orders
- Keeping track of/syncing Shopify and Printify orders

TODO:
Build custom Shopify app to intergrate the API into (custom backend can only be hosted externally with Shopify).
Add /help endpoint to API
